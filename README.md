## 🤖 Agentic AI Architecture

### Master Agent Flow

```
User Message → Master Agent → Route to Worker Agent → Process → Return Response
```

### Worker Agents & Responsibilities

#### 1. Verification Agent
- Validates customer phone number against CRM
- Fetches customer KYC details
- Returns customer profile data

#### 2. Sales Agent
- Calculates EMI based on loan amount & tenure
- Suggests optimal tenure based on salary
- Handles negotiation requests
- Provides loan term breakdown

#### 3. Underwriting Agent
- Fetches credit score from mock bureau API
- Applies business rules:
  - Credit score must be ≥ 700
  - Amount ≤ pre-approved → Instant approval
  - Amount ≤ 2x pre-approved → Requires salary slip
  - EMI must be ≤ 50% of monthly salary
  - Amount > 2x pre-approved → Reject
- Returns approval/rejection decision

#### 4. Sanction Agent
- Generates professional PDF sanction letter
- Includes all loan terms, customer details
- Creates downloadable document
- Provides loan reference number

---

## 📊 Business Logic Implementation

### Eligibility Rules

```python
if credit_score < 700:
    REJECT
elif loan_amount <= pre_approved_limit:
    INSTANT_APPROVE
elif loan_amount <= (2 * pre_approved_limit):
    if salary_slip_uploaded and (EMI <= 50% of salary):
        APPROVE
    else:
        REQUEST_SALARY_SLIP or REJECT
else:
    REJECT (suggest max eligible amount)
```

### Interest Rates

| Tenure | Interest Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| 12 months | 10.50% |
| 24 months | 10.99% |
| 36 months | 11.49% |
| 48 months | 11.99% |
| 60 months | 12.49% |

### EMI Calculation

```
EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / [(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Principal loan amount
r = Monthly interest rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
n = Tenure in months
```
