## 🤖 Agentic AI Architecture

### Master Agent Flow

```
User Message → Master Agent → Route to Worker Agent → Process → Return Response
```

### Worker Agents & Responsibilities

#### 1. Verification Agent
- Validates customer phone number against CRM
- Fetches customer KYC details
- Returns customer profile data

#### 2. Sales Agent
- Calculates EMI based on loan amount & tenure
- Suggests optimal tenure based on salary
- Handles negotiation requests
- Provides loan term breakdown

#### 3. Underwriting Agent
- Fetches credit score from mock bureau API
- Applies business rules:
  - Credit score must be ≥ 700
  - Amount ≤ pre-approved → Instant approval
  - Amount ≤ 2x pre-approved → Requires salary slip
  - EMI must be ≤ 50% of monthly salary
  - Amount > 2x pre-approved → Reject
- Returns approval/rejection decision

#### 4. Sanction Agent
- Generates professional PDF sanction letter
- Includes all loan terms, customer details
- Creates downloadable document
- Provides loan reference number

---

## 📊 Business Logic Implementation

### Eligibility Rules

```python
if credit_score < 700:
    REJECT
elif loan_amount <= pre_approved_limit:
    INSTANT_APPROVE
elif loan_amount <= (2 * pre_approved_limit):
    if salary_slip_uploaded and (EMI <= 50% of salary):
        APPROVE
    else:
        REQUEST_SALARY_SLIP or REJECT
else:
    REJECT (suggest max eligible amount)
```

### Interest Rates

| Tenure | Interest Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| 12 months | 10.50% |
| 24 months | 10.99% |
| 36 months | 11.49% |
| 48 months | 11.99% |
| 60 months | 12.49% |

### EMI Calculation

```
EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / [(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Principal loan amount
r = Monthly interest rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
n = Tenure in months
```

## 🔧 Customization & Extension

### Adding New Customer
Edit `backend/data/customers.py`:
```python
CUSTOMER_DATABASE = {
    '1234567890': {
        'name': 'New Customer',
        'age': 30,
        'city': 'Mumbai',
        'credit_score': 750,
        'pre_approved_limit': 400000,
        'monthly_salary': 100000,
        # ... other fields
    }
}
```

### Modifying Interest Rates
Edit `backend/data/offers.py`:
```python
INTEREST_RATES = {
    12: 10.5,
    24: 10.99,
    # ... add more tenures
}
```

### Changing Business Rules
Edit `backend/agents/underwriting_agent.py`:
```python
def evaluate_eligibility(self, ...):
    # Modify rules here
    if credit_score < 700:  # Change threshold
        return {'approved': False, ...}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
lsof -i :5000
# Kill the process or change port in app.py
```

### CORS errors
- Ensure Flask-CORS is installed: `pip install Flask-CORS`
- Check API_BASE_URL in `frontend/js/app.js`

### PDF generation fails
- Ensure reportlab is installed: `pip install reportlab`
- Check write permissions for `generated_letters/` directory

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:5000
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure CORS is enabled in Flask
